2018/07/19 14:18:06 hello
2018/07/19 14:18:26 okay so i've made the initial project and now for adding the continuous integration.
2018/07/19 14:19:02 first I'll start off with a docker image that I used on lwonprom
2018/07/19 14:21:39 hmm strang error from the bash linter
2018/07/19 14:21:43 strange
2018/07/19 14:22:02 I guess I'll download an MIT license for it
2018/07/19 14:24:27 there fixed the bash error
2018/07/19 14:26:36 also lets see if can get it to actually compile on this computer, as it wasn't working earlier.
2018/07/19 14:27:08 ah it's german lets update that to English
2018/07/19 14:30:34 hmmm have to add the build files to the gitignore
2018/07/19 14:33:03 okay that looks good so will commit and push that
2018/07/19 14:33:43 right that's a remote computer
2018/07/19 14:34:35 i don't see an epub, maybe there is something else to do
2018/07/19 14:35:15 I'll make the README
2018/07/19 14:36:40 okay lets see how it looks on gitlab
2018/07/19 14:38:55 hmmm how to do nested ordered lists on markdown?
2018/07/19 14:47:03 great so to make the nested lists simply have
2018/07/19 14:47:13 additional indentation
2018/07/19 14:47:49 there so the epub creation doesn't work but may not have the dependencies
2018/07/19 14:48:10 I'll move the dependenices higher up so people install them before trying to compile
2018/07/19 14:48:46 oh I guess they are okay prominent can make an apt installne
2018/07/19 14:48:51 line
2018/07/19 14:49:25 can make a note of this for the continuous integration
2018/07/19 14:53:01 seems tex4ebook usage is outdated will have to update it
2018/07/19 14:53:15 first can check how the other things are going
2018/07/19 14:54:01 great so ps pdf and dvi are working
2018/07/19 14:55:43 hmmm will have to look at the tex4ebook documentation
2018/07/19 14:55:52 cause the options are very different from before
2018/07/19 14:57:07 okay so that worked, lets see if it looks nice
2018/07/19 14:59:04 ah will probably need to compile twice to get it to show table of contents
2018/07/19 15:01:20 I'm not 100% sure how he got it to work with the others. lets ee if one of the others does have a table of contents.
2018/07/19 15:02:21 yes it looks like it, oh I know epub table of contents are often at the end.
2018/07/19 15:02:44 anyways i g2g
2018/07/19 15:02:59 will just git commit and finish this of later
2018/07/19 15:04:06 it compiles epub anyways
2018/07/19 15:04:33 will figure out table of contents next time
