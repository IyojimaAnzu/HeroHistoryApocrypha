29th year of the Divine Era, Xth of July.

I was sitting face to face with Fuyou Lilienthal Yuuna.

``It happened around thirty years ago... Back when the seas around Shikoku were not yet surrounded by a wall. People could freely go to any part of Japan. Forget that, they could even go to other, `foreign' countries outside of Japan.''

I quietly split my disposable chopsticks while listening to Fuyou's words.

``I'm sure you've heard of them before, Yuzuki-kun. America, China, England, India, Russia... All names of countries aside from Japan.''

In front of us two were bowls. Bowls filled with udon. The toppings were seaweed, kamaboko and tempura.

``However, in year 2015 of the Christian Era, monsters called `Stardust' or `Vertexes' invaded Japan. A mysterious tree we call `Shinju' and a wall appeared in Shikoku. The Stardust didn't get through the wall and into Shikoku, but the areas outside of it took devastating damage. All of Japan aside from Shikoku was destroyed by the Stardust, and other than Japan... As for the other countries, we became incapable of telling what happened to them. To deal with the Vertexes, an organisation called the Taisha --- although back then their name was written as `Grand Shrine' and not `Amnesty' --- the Taisha somehow managed to maintain public order in Shikoku through their actions.''

I came to that udon restaurant at Fuyou's invitation. It was somewhat far away from our school and our fellow students rarely came there, so she claimed it'd be perfect for the Hero Club's secret strategy meetings. I, however, had no intention of joining the Hero Club.

``Several years after the wall around Shikoku appeared in 2015 CE... Despite the devastation outside the wall, Shikoku maintained a relatively peaceful state of events. Although there were, obviously, many refugees that managed to evacuate to Shikoku during the Stardust invasion, and there was some societal chaos when it came to dealing with those refugees. But those were trifling matters compared to the physical disasters outside the wall. The real action began in 2018 CE.''

I... was slurping on udon.

It was good.

``After 2018, Stardust and Vertexes became able to invade Shikoku through the wall. The ones who protected Shikoku and fought against those monsters were Heroes. The Heroes of Shikoku were stationed at the Marugame castle, and it's commonly thought there were four of them. One of those Heroes was Takashima Yuuna. She was the cornerstone for my and your `Yuuna' names, Yuzuki-kun.''

The mochi tempura went well with udon. No, it was more than just that. What I thought was just chikuwa was actually... shrimp chikuwa. A famous product of the local area. Using something like that in udon? The chefs knew their craft.

``But in their battles against the Vertexes, the Heroes lost their lives one after another. Takashima Yuuna, too, perished in 2019, during the biggest Vertex invasion to date. The only surviving Hero was the great Nogi Wakaba herself. Nogi-sama is still alive and well, and appears in public for public events every now and then.''

Huh... The kamaboko they put in the udon had the Zenigata Sunae --- the coin-shaped sand sculpture that served as the symbol of Kanonji, depicted on it. It was a rather hospitable gesture.

``Yuzuki-kun, are you listening!?''

``...Hm? No, I missed that. Don't want the udon to get soggy.''

``Pearls before swine...''

Fuyou's shoulders dropped in dejection.

``Besides, I already know everything you've just said. It's in textbooks, and I've seen it on the news and on the internet sometimes. Hurry up and eat already, your udon's going to get soggy.''

``W--Well, true enough, what I said was well within the realm of common knowledge. My problem is with the events after 2019 CE... After the calendar was changed to the Divine Era! Here, take a look at the blog I run!''

Fuyou opened her school bag, pulled a tablet out of it and opened a webpage. It was a blog called ``Hero Club's Digital Base -- Uncovering the truth behind the Heroes, the wall and the Vertexes.'' The articles in the blog read ``The Taisha Conspiracy'', ``Vertexes and the lies of the Apollo Project'', ``Shinju through the lens of ancient Japanese spiritualism'' and ``Witch hunts, Heroes and apocalyptic prophecies'', amongst others.

Even the titles were suspicious. Suspicious to the extreme.

Fuyou opened one the of the articles --- ``Doubts concerning the existence of Vertexes'' --- and passed the tablet to me. While I was reading the article, she took her own chopsticks, split them and began eating her udon. How she split her chopsticks, how she ate udon... Every single one of her actions was pretty.

However...

``Just as it says there, all of it is vile trickery and dirty lies by the Taisha! We're all being deceived! They're concealing the truth to control the populace, to brainwash the society!'' Fuyou said with glowing eyes.

She'd be a normal pretty girl if she didn't act like that. But alas, her beauty was wasted on her behaviour.

The gist of the article Fuyou opened for me was ``It's uncertain if Heroes or Vertexes ever existed''.

I've heard something of the sort on the internet and in rumours before. It was a conspiracy theory of sorts.

``Listen up! A mere thirty years or so have passed since the time period when the Vertexes were around, yet there's virtually no concrete proof of their existence! There are no public records, images or footage of them either! There are a few images of the Vertexes floating around on the internet, but there's a high possibility of them being CG or photoshopped fakes! It's impossible to find any images or videos of the Heroes fighting the Vertexes too! All this was supposedly just thirty years ago! Isn't it weird for there to be so little info!? Even if we assume --- and that's a really big `if' --- that the Vertexes existed, they completely stopped attacking Shikoku after 2019 CE. In that case, it's perfectly natural to assume that something led to their elimination.''

Not paying any attention to Fuyou's words, I looked at the comment section.

``It's a part of the Rothschild remnants' plan to take over the world.''

``These past few days, the mental waves have been whispering the same things to me.''

``Is this a psyop!?''

``It's important to wear yellow. Yellow reflects the Vertex toxins and protects the mind.''

And so on... It was a gathering of complete conspiracy nutjobs.

``I've heard that the Vertexes and Stardust stopped coming to Shikoku because the Taisha conducted some sort of ritual.''

Fuyou shook her head in response.

``Self-contradictory nonsense! There are no public records of what kind of ritual exactly it was, and nobody knows the details. And if a simple ritual could stop the fight, why didn't they do it from the start!? There was no way for them to wait until nearly all the Heroes were dead and massive damage was dealt!''

Fuyou wasn't wrong. Why didn't the Taisha conduct that ritual until they were cornered?

``My theory is that the Vertexes never existed, and the stories about Heroes fighting them are all fake. Even if they did exist, they perished in 2019. Have you read the classic story, War of the Worlds by H. G. Wells?''

``No, I haven't...''

``It's about aliens that invade Earth, and so after those aliens wreak havoc, they all suddenly die in an anticlimactic way. Humans don't defeat them, mind you. Earth's air just doesn't fit them and they all die. Strictly speaking, what kills them are the bacteria in air... Anyway, what if the Vertexes and Stardust all died out like that too?''

``But... If that's true, why is Shikoku still surrounded by a wall and we aren't allowed outside? Isn't that weird?''

The moment I said those words, Fuyou's lips curled into a smile that was best described as ``satisfied''.

``Heh heh heh. Yuzuki-kun, seems like curiosity about the conspiracy surrounding the wall welled up in you too!''

(Oh crap! It was a trap!)

I was the one to raise that question, which made it look like I had an interest in the topic.

With a ``gotcha'' written all over her face, Fuyou extended a hand to me.

``Carpe diem! If you're curious, then join my Hero Club immediately! The goal of the Hero Club is to overcome the wall surrounding Shikoku and venture beyond! Once we are past the wall, the truth of the world will become apparent! Now, it's time to join the club! Right now!''

``No way.''

I bluntly refused, finished eating my udon, took my chopsticks and left my seat.

``Aaah, Yuzuki-kun, just a moment! I need to finish my food!''

Fuyou began to hurriedly gulp down her udon.

It'd been several days since I met Fuyou at the Ryuo shrine.

Every day she would approach me several times to invite me to join her ``Hero Club''. The Hero Club was, apparently, about uncovering the truth behind the various incidents that occurred during the turn of the era from Christian to Divine, as well as the Vertexes, the Heroes and the wall. By the way, despite her invitations, the Hero Club wasn't even officially recognised by the school.

The club's goal was to get across the wall, outside Shikoku. Thirty odd years ago the Heroes went on an expedition outside Shikoku, or so we're told. The club intended to do the same and follow in their footsteps. Thus, the name.

But both Fuyou and I were nothing more than ordinary schoolgirls. We couldn't possibly get over the wall that nobody had gone outside of for thirty years. Fuyou's Hero Club would just end without having accomplished anything. I would rather spend my time obtaining power than waste it on something like that. I still had no idea how to obtain it, however.

It was the last Saturday before the summer holidays. I finished eating my breakfast and was watching the news on my phone. Depicted on the screen was a woman in her mid-forties, doing a martial arts demonstration for a religious ceremony. The woman's name was Nogi Wakaba-sama. A master of iaido and swordsmanship, she was the sole surviving Hero that had fought against the Vertexes. Next to her was Uesato Hinata-sama, a woman her age. Nogi-sama was the face of the Taisha, the absolute power ruling over Shikoku, and Uesato-sama was the de facto top of their management.

Nogi-sama's martial arts demonstration had ended. She looked no different to any other person. On the other hand, the Vertexes were said to range from several metres to several dozens of metres big. No matter how good her swordsmanship, it was unthinkable that Nogi-sama could've fought the Vertexes and won. It was said that the Heroes received special powers from the gods that granted them strength... But no footage of them using those powers remained.

Which is why people like Fuyou, who came up with conspiracies about the Heroes and Vertexes, appeared every now and then.

It was then that I got a sudden call from Fuyou Yuuna.

``Hello?''

``Yuzuki...kun?''

Her voice was faint, as if it would disappear any second.

``What's wrong?''

``...No, nothing. Sorry to bother you on a day off...''

Fuyou's voice was weak. It was clear that she was hesitating to say something. But something about her voice made it seem like she was asking for help.

``...It hasn't been long, but... thanks for everything. Well then... Farewell...''

Fuyou was about to hang up. Was she going to do something dangerous after the call ended?

``Wait, hold on! Did something happen!? Where are you right now?''

``...''

After a prolonged silence, I heard the waves from the phone's speaker. Was she at the coast?

``I'll be there now! Wait for me!''

``...''

Fuyou ended the call without saying anything.

I dashed out of the house and rushed towards the Ariake beach in the Kotohiki park.

Fuyou stood there at the beach, alone.

``With bated breath! I've been waiting for you, Yuzuki-kun! Now, let the Hero Club's activities begin immediately!''

There wasn't even a trace of the frailty I'd heard over the phone. She was bright and lively.

``...Huh?''

``Let the Hero Club's activities begin!''

``What the hell was that call just now!?''

I thought she was about to kill herself!

``I thought you'd come if I put it like that. It was my first time seriously acting in a while, but I was surprisingly good, don't you think?''

Oh right, Fuyou was a former child talent. She was exceptionally good at putting emotions into her words and attitude. I got completely fooled.

``...I'm going home.''

``Waah, wait, wait! My bad, just listen to me! I looked into you, and found something interesting!''

``What exactly?''

``You help the girls' basketball, tennis and volleyball clubs out, don't you? As a part-time gig, for 1000 yen a match.''

Where did she get that info?

The only people who knew that I was earning money by helping the sports clubs were the club presidents and a few of the club members. And all of them were tight-lipped. No outsiders knew about it until then.

It would've been bad if others caught word of it. The teachers would've probably gotten angry and I'd likely have been banned from helping out again.

``I'm not trying to blackmail you with this secret of yours. I'm just wondering if you'd be willing to help the Hero Club the same way you help the sports clubs.''

``How am I supposed to trust someone who goes around digging dirt on peo--''

``1000 yen an hour.''

``...!''

``That's how much I'm willing to pay for your services. A cut above the other clubs' 1000 yen a match rate, wouldn't you agree?''

After a long period of hesitation, I finally nodded and said, ``...Got it.''

True enough, 1000 yen an hour was an alluring proposition. But... This, and back at the Ryuo shrine... Weren't I getting a bit too easily swayed by Fuyou's words?

``It's settled then! Let's celebrate by doing the Hero Club's first assignment!''

``First? Weren't you doing things in the club all by your own until now?''

Fuyou's eyes began darting around.

``W--Well, that's... I was thinking this wasn't the kind of thing fit to do by yourself. I was waiting for club members to join.''

What kind of person would even join a bizarre club like hers? What was she planning to do if I didn't agree to join as a helper?

``More importantly, here's the plan for today! Just like I said earlier, the Hero Club's goal is to get over the wall surrounding Shikoku and go outside it. And today we will be taking the first step towards that goal by looking for a land route we could use to cross it.''

``A land route...?''

``Before the wall appeared in 2015, Shikoku was connected to Honshu by three bridges. The Great Seto Bridge in Kagawa, the Oonaruto Bridge in Tokushima and the Kurushima Kaikyo Bridge in Ehime. Let's try those.''

``Got it. Have you checked how to get there?''

Fuyou's eyes opened wide in surprise.

``Ooh, you seem ready and willing. I expected more fuss and muss from you, something like `Why do we have to go all the way out there?'"

``Right now, I'm helping this club. You hired me, so I'll spare no effort to help with whatever you want.''

``Would be nice if you just became a club member, though.''

``I'll pass.''

``A shame... Oh, by the way.''

``What?''

``Thanks for worrying about me when I called you. It made me happy.''

Fuyou smiled at me, and for some reason my cheeks reddened.

Fuyou's plan was to check the three bridges on the weekend.

On that day --- Saturday, that is --- she planned to visit the Great Seto Bridge in the morning and the Oonaruto Bridge in the afternoon. On the next day --- on Sunday --- she was going to visit the Kurushima Kaikyo Bridge.

The plan for the day was to travel through both Kagawa and Tokushima, so we would have to act in a pretty big hurry.

We got on a rapid train at Kanonji, where we lived, and got off at the Utazu station.

``Why Utazu? Wouldn't it make more sense to get off at Sakaide if we want to get to the Great Seto Bridge?''

While we were on the train, I was checking directions towards the Great Seto Bridge. The bus going towards the Great Seto Bridge memorial park left from the Sakaide station, one stop after Utazu.

``If you just look at the distance, then sure, Sakaide is closer to the bridge than Utazu.''

``But there aren't any buses going from Utazu either.''

``With a bus you're looking at a massive time loss if you miss the return trip. Besides, we're not going to the memorial park. We're trying to survey the surroundings of the bridge itself. Going there on a bus then walking around would take a lot of time. And Kagawa has certain `legs' that are a lot more convenient than that.''

``And that would be?''

``Rental bikes.''

It all made sense.

Bike rentals were a frequently offered service in Kagawa. At tourist info centres, station hotels, bicycle shops, smartphone app rental spots and so on. Other prefectures had them too, but they were particularly prolific in Ehime and Kagawa.

I heard from my mother that Kagawa's bike rentals had a fairly long history, and were actively offered to tourists even back in the Christian Era days. And after Shikoku was surrounded by a wall in the Divine Era, their convenience made their numbers increase even more.

Fuyou opened a bike rental app on her phone and reserved two electric bicycles. The distance from the Utazu station to the Great Seto Bridge was 5.5 km. Easy enough of a distance to cover on an electric bike.

``I didn't think of this way.''

``Heh heh, I'm good at investigating things and coming up with stuff. Just leave it to me.''

Fuyou seemed pleased with herself.

Considering that she managed to sniff out the fact I was helping the sports club as a part-time job, she really must've been good at investigating things. She was a weirdo, but she seemed to have a good head on her shoulders, all things considered.

``Okay, off we go!'' Fuyou raised her hand in the air and said commandingly.

And that was the end of her cheerfulness.

``Wheeze, wheeze... It's hot... My legs are tired... I'm done, I'm so done... Wheeze, I'm dying...''

Despite using a motor-powered bicycle, Fuyou was incapable of even covering 5.5 km.

``Just how wimpy are you...?''

``Yuzuki-kun... Haah, haah... Can you let me sit on the back of your bike?''

``Denied. Are you going to just leave the rental bike here?''

``Ugh... Maybe we... should've taken the bus after all... Haah, haah...''

``Come on, just a little more. We've only got a kilometre to go until we reach the Great Seto Bridge memorial park.''

As I kept constantly encouraging the barely-breathing Fuyou on the way there, we somehow made it to the memorial park.

``I'm done... I can't move...''

Fuyou dropped on the bench like a corpse.

``At my last gasp... Yuzuki-kun... I leave the investigation of the Great Seto Bridge... to you...''

``You're helpless. Okay, what kind of investigation am I supposed to do?''

Fuyou took a pair of binoculars out of her backpack and gave them to me. The binoculars looked like a rather expensive pair, too.

``I want you to get on the observation platform in the park... And see if the bridge extends to the wall... Or cuts off halfway through. And if it reaches the wall... See if there's a way to get to the Great Seto Bridge... I'll be here waiting and recovering...''

``Alright, alright, got it.''

I left Fuyou at the bench and went to the observation platform at the Great Seto Bridge memorial museum. It wasn't a particularly high observation platform, but it provided a good enough view of the bridge and the wall.

When I took a look through the binoculars, it looked like the bridge was connected to the wall in the place where they intersected.

I left the observation platform, got on the bike and searched for an entry onto the bridge, consulting the map on my phone. I spent an hour circling the area, but all the entries were blocked off. I decided to return to the bench at the park.

``How did it go?''

Fuyou was looking better, so she must've rested enough to regain her energy.

``Looks like the Great Seto Bridge is connected to the wall. But I couldn't find any way to enter it.''

``I see, I see... But this is only our first attempt! Let us go to the second bridge!''

Fuyou triumphantly stood up from the bench, and went pale immediately afterwards.

``Oh right, we have to bike back too...''

With Fuyou on the verge of death, we somehow returned to Utazu.

Our next destination was the Oonaruto Bridge in Tokushima.

We took an express train from Utazu to Takamatsu, then changed lines there and eventually arrived at the Ikenotani station. At that point we had already crossed the borders of Kagawa and were in Tokushima.

The Ikenotani station was small, but it was the starting point of the Naruto train line, so we had to start there to reach the Naruto station, the closest station to the Oonaruto Bridge.

After getting off at the Naruto station, we proceeded by bus.

``We were unable to access the Great Seto Bridge, but the Oonaruto Bridge has a pedestrian walkway! It should give us more access to the wall!''

We got off at the Naruto park bus station and immediately headed towards the nearby Oonaruto Bridge.

There was a pedestrian walkway called Uzu-no-Michi, the Whirlpool Walkway, inside the bridge, and we were able to enter the bridge through it.

Part of the floor in that walkway was made out of glass, so you could see the ocean deep down under your feet. The famous Naruto whirlpools were visible on the water's surface.

``Ooh...''

Impressed by the view, I let out a voice by accident.

``Take a look, Fuyou. The whirlpool is awesome.''

``Y--Yuzuki-kun, we're not here to see the whirlpool today. L--Let's hurry up and go.''

For some reason, Fuyou was hurrying onwards without looking down below.

``...You're not scared of looking down, are you?''

``N--N--N--N--Nonsense, of course I'm not!''

She totally was.

The bridge was pretty high up, admittedly, but Fuyou was also really easily scared.

I lightly pushed her back and made her stand on the glass. She then began screaming with tears in her eyes, ``Waaah, I'm gonna fall, gonna fall! Save me!''

In the end, the walkway was also blocked off halfway through, and the wall was inaccessible.

We took the bus from the Oonaruto Bridge back to the Naruto station.

\begin{figure}[p]

\end{figure}

There was a footbath at the bus stop, so we decided to take a break there.

``Aah, this is relaxing... Today has been abuse for my feet...''

Fuyou was soaking her feet in the water with a blissful expression.

``Fuyou, I've got a questi--''

``It's Lily.''

``Eh?''

``Don't call me Fuyou, call me Lily. As in Lilienthal. That's what my classmates call me.''

``Lily, then. Not that it really matters, but is Lilienthal your middle name?''

``Kind of like that, yeah. It's just `Fuyou Yuuna' in my family registry, though. But I've been calling myself Fuyou Lilienthal Yuuna since my days in showbiz. Oh yeah, have I mentioned being in showbiz before?''

``You haven't, but I know about it.''

``Right. Lilienthal was my mother's maiden name, you see. I like it a lot, though. By the way, Yuzuki-kun, if you want me to call you some other way, just tell me.''

``I don't have a middle name, so just Yuzuki is fine. I don't like the name Yuuna.''

``Alright. So be it, Yuzuki-kun.''

Lily's face looked relaxed. It must've been because of the footbath.

``Hey, Lily. The travel costs and my wages must add up to a pretty hefty sum, you sure you're going to be fine?''

Fuyou had been shouldering all of the travel expenses. If you added up the bike rentals, train and bus fares and my hiring costs, the sum would be considerable.

``Yeah, don't worry about it. I've got... more money than I know what to do with. Savings from my showbiz days.''

``But...''

``I said it's fine. No matter how much I use,'' said Lily with a hint of sadness, looking at her feet in the water.

The next day...

``The Great Seto Bridge and the Oonaruto Bridge? Those were just a warm-up. The Kurushima Kaikyo bridge in Ehime is the real deal!'' said Lily when we got on the Yosan line and headed towards Ehime.

``The real deal? Is there something special about it?''

``Back in the Christian Era, Ehime had a road across the Seto Inland Sea going through a bunch of islands in it. The Kurushima Kaikyo Bridge was the starting point for that road, and if you walked all the way through it, you'd end up in Honshu. Which means that there's a possibility the bridge still goes as far as the wall!''

Fuyou's eyes were glowing, but I was sceptical. If going outside the wall was that easy, anyone in Shikoku could've done that.

Fuyou and I changed trains and got off at the Hashihama station, rented bikes there and headed towards the bridge. The road leading up to the Kurushima Kaikyo Bridge was still being called the Shimanami Expressway, but the name originally referred to the entire road connecting Ehime to Honshu.

Pedalling our bikes, we finally reached the bridge. Looking to our sides, all we saw was the vast sea filling our entire field of view.

The wind on the bridge was incredibly strong.

``T--This wind is shaking it a lot... It's pretty scary...''

``Lily, you're tiny, so try not to get blown away.''

``I'm not tiny! You're just too huge!''

Bickering with each other like that, we pedalled on.

``Apparently, back when the wall just appeared, a lot of scientists said that the water conditions and ecosystem would change a lot and the seas around Shikoku would turn into something completely different.''

``Really?''

``Yeah. They said that the Naruto whirlpool we saw yesterday would disappear, and that the ocean would become dirty and polluted, killing off most life there. But that didn't happen, and we still have the same sea as before the wall appeared. The Taisha say it's Shinju-sama's divine protection. But I... I don't believe the Shinju's powers. There has to be a scientific explanation for this.''

We kept moving through the Shimanami Expressway.

And, eventually, stopped our bikes.

In front of us was an iron fence, blocking any further passage. Far behind the fence, the wall surrounding Shikoku was visible.

``...All for nothing,'' said I.

``No, not for nothing.''

Lily didn't seem dejected at all.

``But we can't go any further than this.''

``We learned that we can't go across. That's enough of a result. Besides, this is the closest we've gotten to the wall yet.''

Lily took out her binoculars and looked at the wall.

``From here you can see the wall pretty well through the binoculars. And I've found something. Come take a look, Yuzuki-kun.''

I took Lily's binoculars and looked towards the wall. Normally it wasn't possible to see the surface of the wall, but one could do that with the binoculars from that spot.

The wall was made out of plant vines or branches of some kind, tightly bound together without any space between them. I had expected something made out of concrete, like a breakwater, but that was completely different. It wasn't made of inorganic matter, but a bundle of organic.

While I was looking at the wall, Lily pulled yet another pair of binoculars, or something similar, out of her backpack.

``Are those binoculars too?''

``No, this is a laser rangefinder. It shoots a laser out, and when it hits an object, you can measure how far away it is or how big it is.''

Using the rangefinder, Lily began to measure the distance to the wall and its size. Then she took out a notebook and began writing down the measured numbers.

``True enough, we weren't able to get over the wall using either of the three bridges. But by approaching it like this, we were able to measure its size and see its composition. This is important data, and is sure to help us in our wall-crossing quest. Nothing we've done was in vain.''

``...Right.''

``And besides, even if we hadn't found anything out... I got to go on a fun trip with you, Yuzuki-kun, and I'd say that was a fairly good use of my time.''

``...''

``Yuzuki-kun, are you embarrassed, by any chance?''

``Shut it. Let's just hurry up and go home.''

I put my feet on the pedals and turned back.

``Waah, don't leave me here! I'm too scared to go back alone! You can see the water under the bridge from up here!''

Lily scrambled to chase me.

When we came back from Ehime to Kanonji, the sun was beginning to set.

``I need to pay you for the past two days. I used up all my money on hand paying our travel expenses, so stop by my house,'' said Lily when we left the train.

``Adding up the two days, I've kept you busy for 13 hours, which adds up to 13000 yen of pay.''

``No, but...''

``Yuzuki-kun, your house was by the Saida river, correct? My house is close by too.''

``...I'm impressed you know where I live.''

``I did say I'm good at investigating,'' said Lily with a proud expression.

``...I can't take the payment, after all.''

``So you're saying you're willing to officially become a member of the Hero Club!?''

Lily bent forward in excitement.

``No, I'm not.''

``I see...''

Lily's shoulders dropped.

``All I did for the past two days was follow you along, Lily. I didn't do nearly enough to deserve this money.''

``Not at all! Besides... There's no point for me to have all this money anyway.''

Lily's place was in an apartment complex across the river from my house. The building was even visible from my veranda. She opened the door with the name card that read ``Fuyou'', but nobody was home.

``I'm back.''

Lily passed through the living room, heading towards a room further inside.

``Excuse me.''

I followed her inside.

An altar was placed further inside, and Lily clapped her hands together. A photo of a pretty woman was placed in the altar, and the woman somewhat resembled Lily.

``Is that...''

``It's my mother's altar. She died from an illness a while ago.''

Lily did say that Lilienthal was her mother's maiden name. So that's how it was. Her mother was dead...

``She was from America. In 2015, when the wall appeared, she just so happened to be in Japan on a trip. She had been living in Shikoku ever since.''

``...''

``Her parents and siblings were in America, and she didn’t know what happened to them ever since the Vertexes appeared. We didn't even have info about what happened to Japan, let alone foreign countries. Up until she died, Mother always worried about her family back home. She said that when society returned to normal and people could go outside the wall again, she wanted to visit her home one more time...''

Lily stood up.

``Well, you just wait. I'll bring your payment.''

She went into another room, then quickly came back to the living room and handed me some bills. One 10 000-yen bill and 3 1000-yen bills.

After I came back home, I was in my room, tightly gripping the money I received from Lily.

Her dead mother used to say she wanted to return back home. And Lily...

The reason behind her fixation on the wall and going outside it must've been her mother.

``It... has to be that.''

I put the money into a drawer and locked it.

I decided to put up with her eccentricity for a little longer.

Oh, lamentations! I am not a child!

Even remembering it makes me indignant.

A few days ago, when I approached the captain of the girls' volleyball club to draw information out of her, she told me that in exchange for telling me Yuzuki-kun's secret (that she helps the club out for money) she wanted to hug me... And when she was hugging me, she kept patting my head and saying things like ``cute, so cute, you're in middle school but look like an elementary schooler, such an adorable baby girl''. It was to get a bargaining chip for Yuzuki-kun, yes, and I do not mind being called cute when I resemble my mother so much. But thinking about it, saying ``looks like an elementary schooler'' and ``baby girl'' about me was incredibly rude! Coupled with the rumours about how the captain of the girls' volleyball club has pedo inclinations, it makes me feel queasy.

I might be short, yes. But I'm not young enough to be called a child! I'm an adult woman!

Remembering that made me so furious, I couldn't help but scribble this down.

Well, today was the second day of our bridge investigation. With this, my investigations of the Great Seto Bridge, the Oonaruto Bridge and the Kurushima Kaikyo Bridge are done. As expected, leaving Shikoku using those routes proved impossible. All is within expectations, however. I never expected being able to go outside this easily in the first place.

But there were results.

Using the Kurushima Kaikyo route, I was able to get somewhat close to the wall by getting on the pedestrian/car road on the bridge. Using the laser rangefinder, I was also able to measure the size of the wall.

The height of the wall is around 200 metres, with possibility of deviations and measurement errors.

This data might come in use one day, when I am about to get over the wall.

The Hero Club has only just begun its activities. Yuzuki-kun seems to believe I've been acting alone all this time, but she's... wrong. I only came up with this Hero Club after Mother died. Just recently. And I haven't done anything after I came up with it.

I think I'm a coward. I couldn't do anything on my own. She might just be a helper right now, but I'm glad I found a comrade like Yuzuki-kun.
