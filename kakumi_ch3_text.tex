I am mediocre.

My height is just around the middle of my female classmates. So are my grades. My athletic skills are middling too. I was born to average parents and grew up in an average household. I have nothing remarkable in my past, hold no particular secrets and have no special gift either.

I am mundane. Mediocrity made manifest.

Yuu-chan is different. Kumiko-san is different, too. That day, when the white monsters appeared, I couldn't do a thing to protect those precious to me.

My ability to detect the monsters is nothing special compared to Yuu-chan's ability to defeat them.

If Yuu-chan was in my place, she definitely could've rescued Mom and Dad.

Kumiko-san has both the brains and the agility to deal with the monsters without any fear. She could've probably rescued Mom and Dad, too.

The two of them are special.

So why am I not special like the two of them?

Why am I not special?

Why must I wallow in powerless mediocrity?

``Her parents got killed by those monsters?''

``Yes...''

I was talking to Yuuna while driving the bus in the direction of the Great Seto Bridge. \\
Matsuri was sleeping so soundly, you'd think she had fainted. Not only was she exhausted from the lack of sleep, seeing blood must've taken a toll on her mental state as well.

Matsuri's reaction to the bleeding woman seemed almost excessive. It's not uncommon for people to dislike seeing blood. Even in my university there were natural sciences and medical students that simply couldn't stomach doing dissection experiments. But Yokote Matsuri's reaction to seeing blood was a step above mere ``disliking'' it.

When I asked Yuuna about it, her eyes showed a reluctance to talk. After I pressed her, she finally began to speak.

``Matsuri-san's father and mother... Were killed by those white monsters, it seems. I didn't see them get killed, but... When I first met Matsuri-san, she was covered in blood and her eyes were empty... And she said that her parents got killed by white monsters in front of her eyes...''

I had asked Matsuri about her meeting with Yuuna earlier, but she told me a different story then. Matsuri avoided telling me about how her parents got slaughtered.

Seeing her parents die right before her eyes. That was the reason behind Matsuri's hemophobia.

``I'm sorry, but it's about time.''

A man around thirty came up to the driver seat and called out to me. He was a doctor by trade, and constantly looked after the health of other passengers on the bus. The idea of frequent stops to assuage the mental and physical exhaustion of a prolonged bus ride came from him, as well.

``Oh, you're right.''

I nodded in response to the doctor's words and stopped the bus at the parking lot of a convenience store I spotted nearby. We had been stopping for breaks almost every thirty minutes.

``What, another stop?''

A brown-haired woman sitting near the driver seat asked in a complaining tone. She was either my age or slightly younger. Her sluggish voice and wrinkled forehead betrayed her irritation.

``We have seniors and injured on board. It's preferable for us to take as many breaks on our way there as we can'', the doctor kindly explained to Brown Hair.

``Yeah, and do you know how long it's gonna take us to get to Shikoku that way? Wouldn't it be healthier to get to safety as fast as possible and ditch the bus?'' Brown Hair responded.

She was not wrong. We had no way of knowing which option between going slowly with breaks and hurrying towards our destination with no rest was better. We would only be able to say things like ``This was the right choice'' ``We should've done that instead'' with the power of hindsight once we actually arrived.

``It was my decision as a medical pro-''

``I decided to do this'', I cut off the doctor, addressing Brown Hair.

``I'm driving this bus. I'm the one who decides where and how we're going to proceed. You're free to get off and be on your own if you don't like it.''  Brown Hair went silent, but her irritated stare remained directed at me.

I got off the bus and went inside the convenience store.

More than three days had passed since we set out from Gose. It was hard to tell how long it had been since any of us saw an alive human aside from those on the bus.

The windows of the convenience store were broken, the shelves either fallen or torn to pieces. The white monsters must've broken into the store and trashed it.

There was barely anything left even on the shelves that were still intact. The obvious food and drink aside, hygiene products like tissues and batteries were also absent.

Whenever we made a stop, we tried to make it at a supermarket or a convenience store to stock up on food, but the recent stretch of shops had very little remaining on the shelves. Someone must've come here before us and taken the goods.

The problem of securing food was our most pressing issue.

I went behind the counter to check if water was still running. It was not.

The absence of drink was even more critical of an issue than the absence of food. The human body can handle being without food for a surprising amount of time, but can't handle even a day without water.

If we were too slow to reach Shikoku, the lack of food would have definitely become an issue.

I entered the storage room and saw Black Shirt and his cronies, who arrived there before me, stuff the remaining bottles with drinks into bags.

``Leave some for the others.''

Black Shirt glanced at me and responded to my provocation.

``I know. We're not planning to hog this stuff for ourselves. We'll share with the guys still on the bus,'' he said with annoyance and continued to collect the drinks.

``I'll have some.''

I grabbed three bottles of mineral water from their bag without waiting for their answer. Their glares at me were murderous, but glaring was all they did, without even saying anything.

I left the store and went back to the bus.

People were free to spend their breaks however they wanted, but for the last few stops the amount of people who went outside the bus was decreasing. The accumulated fatigue must've left them without the energy to even go outside.

Next to the bus stood Yuuna, blankly staring at the still-dark sky.

``Hey, Yuuna.''

I passed Yuuna one of the bottles I took from Black Shirt.

``Thank you very much.''

``Even you must be getting tired by now, right?''

``Ahaha... I am. But it somehow feels more than just that...''

Yuuna forced a weak, manufactured smile but stopped in the middle of her words.

``Did something happen?''

``Maybe it's just my imagination, but there's something weird. The people on the bus...''

``Weird?''

I was bound to the driver's seat, so I couldn't have a grasp on the state of the bus in its entirety. But Yuuna occasionally changed seats and talked with the other passengers. She likely had a better idea of what was going on in the bus.

``More and more people don't want to leave the bus even during stops.''

``Yeah, I noticed that too. Aren't they just tired because of how long the trip is taking?''

``I think it's more than that. It's like they're not tired, but... afraid to go outside?''

Afraid...?

If Yuuna's guess was right, it was definitely different from ``I'm too exhausted to go outside''. While it would've made sense for them to be afraid of the monsters from a psychological standpoint, there weren't any people afraid to go outside when we left Gose. There was, of course, the possibility that I just didn't notice them at the time.

Was something going on, unseen to me?

Break time was over and we returned to the bus. We resumed our journey towards Shikoku, but stopped again after around half an hour of driving. Our stop was at a gas station. The need to procure fuel also took up time now and then.

The bus came to a stop, which woke Matsuri up.

``Where are we?''

``On the bus. You lost consciousness and fainted. It hasn't been that long, though. We still haven't left Hyogo.''

``Matsuri-san, are you okay? Drink some water. Kumiko-san got us some.''

Yuuna gave Matsuri a bottle of mineral water.

``Thanks...''

Matsuri took the bottle and began to softly gulp the water down. Her face was still pale.

Some people left the bus to go outside, but it was definitely a smaller number than before. Nearly everyone who remained inside had a grim look on their face. They wouldn't even look through the windows.

``Matsuri. Sorry to spring this on you right after waking up, but are there monsters near us?''

``Uh... No, I don't think there are. Probably...''

I turned to Yuuna.

``Then go to sleep for a while, Yuuna. We're all goners if you can't exercise your powers when the time comes.''

``Okay, I understand.''

Yuuna seemed worried about Matsuri, but she understood her role. She reclined her seat and closed her eyes.

I left the bus to refuel.

The sky remained dark.

I had no idea how many days it had been since we left Gose. I was readying the gas pump when Matsuri came out of the bus.

``Are you fine leaving the bus?''

``Yes... Though I still don't feel good.''

``It's not just a matter of how you feel. The people inside the bus are beginning to fear the outside.''

``Is that so?''

``Yeah. There wasn't anything like that when we set out from Gose. The human mind is unpredictable. It makes sense that psychology and psychiatry are such massive scientific fields. I couldn't guess what kind of reason pushed you to lie about your parents' deaths, either.''

``...Did Yuu-chan tell you?''

``That she did. She didn't want to talk about it, but I pulled it out of her. So they died right before your eyes, is that so?''

Buses run on either diesel or gasoline, and our ride was a diesel one. We kept talking as I refueled.

``...Yes. When the white monsters appeared... When I said I'd check out the shelter, it was night, so Mom and Dad stopped me. Told me to do it tomorrow. Of course they'd stop me. The designated shelter was a school near our house, there was no reason to even check anything. Plus, Nara hadn't experienced any serious disasters like the other areas... So there was no need for me to go out so late at night. If I just thought rationally, I would've understood... But something came over me that night.''

I kept listening to Matsuri's story as the fuel kept pouring.

``I kept insisting on going outside and my parents gave in, saying they would come with me... So the three of us went outside.''

``Makes sense that your parents would want to accompany their daughter trying to go outside at night. Especially if the daughter in question was clearly not in the right state of mind.''

Matsuri's head dropped and she continued, speaking slowly.

``The three of us went outside... And when we came near the school... The earthquake happened and those monsters appeared. A monster opened its mouth right in front of me... Then Dad tackled Mom and me to save us... And his body got gnawed to pieces... I could see that his bones and organs were being turned into mush, but there were no loud sounds like you see in movies and manga. Just... Dad's shrieks of pain. Mom and I got covered in blood gushing out of his mouth and burst stomach... Mom told me to run away, and so I did, screaming... But Mom went towards that monster to try and save Dad... Even knowing she couldn't possibly have done that. Ever since then, every time I see blood... the visions of Dad and Mom dying come back to me...''

Matsuri's voice was shaking.  ``In the end, I was the only survivor... Even though Dad and Mom just went together with me... If only I hadn't insisted on going out that night... My parents would have still been alive... It's all my fault.''

Matsuri must've met Yuuna after that happened.

``Monsters appeared all over the country that night. It's likely that your parents would've encountered the monsters even if they hadn't been accompanying you.''

``...''

``When Yuuna puts her gauntlets on, her physical abilities increase drastically. When I tried doing the same, nothing happened. Those gauntlets must be for Yuuna's personal use. It's because Yuuna is using them that she can deal lethal damage to the monsters. And did you not find those gauntlets, Matsuri?''

``I did...''

``Thanks to your parents, you were able to survive and give those gauntlets to Yuuna. And thanks to Yuuna being able to defeat the monsters, many people's lives have been saved. The people on the bus and in the supermarket at Gose, all of them were saved by you and Yuuna. Your parents' sacrifice saved many people.''

``But...''

``Can't accept that, I guess? You can't quantify the value of human lives in mere numbers, after all.''

``It would've been better if it was just me that died...'' Matsuri mumbled, her head still cast downward.

Matsuri spent some time gazing at the dark sky, but eventually returned to the bus with shaky steps.

I finished refueling the bus.

I saw a single woman worriedly looking around, somewhat away from the bus. It was the woman who injured her leg while running away from a monster during one of our earlier stops.

``What are you doing? Better not move too much, you're injured.''

``But my daughter... She's gone.''

``Gone?''

``Yes. She went outside while I was resting... And still hasn't come back. I got worried and went to look for her, but I still can't find her anywhere.'' \\
I took a look around the gas station. It was a lonely gas station right before a mountain trail, so there was little in the surroundings aside from a few private houses, the forest and some abandoned cars. But houses and the forest made for great hiding places.

``When did she leave the bus?''

``20-30 minutes ago, I think. She's 5 years old and has a ribbon. What if she strayed too far and can't find her way back...?''

Ribbon Girl... The one that Matsuri got along with.

With 20-30 minutes of head start even a little girl could go pretty far away. It was highly likely she got lost.

I went back inside the bus and explained the situation to the rest of the passengers.

Matsuri was shaken by the news. No surprise, since the two of them had become friends.

``Let's search for her right now! What if the monsters come!?''

Matsuri's voice was filled with impatience, yet the other passengers' reactions were dull. Nobody even rose from their seat.

``You say look for her but... You know?''

``It's your kid... Why didn't you look after her properly?''

``Tch...''

Stress and hatred filled the air. The sounds of arguing voices woke Yuuna up.

``Uh, did something happen?''

``A girl who was with us disappeared. She left the bus on her own, she could've gotten lost.''

After hearing Matsuri's explanation, Yuuna hurriedly jumped up from her seat.

``Really!? We have to look for her!''

Matsuri, Yuuna and Ribbon Girl's mother left the bus.

However, nobody else rose from their seat. Many had their eyes closed, pretending to sleep, or looked away to avoid facing me.

Everyone was tired.

But there was more to it than mere exhaustion.

``I'll look for them too,'' curtly put the doctor and stood up. He seemed exhausted, like the rest, but sluggishly went outside nonetheless. I followed him.

``You seem to still have a relatively clear mind. I have a question.''

I drew near the doctor.

``...What is it?''

He looked at me with confusion.

``The passengers are becoming unable to go outside, one by one. Some are just too tired to do it, but some say they're too scared to go outside. What do you think of that?''

The doctor went quiet for a while, as if picking the right words, then spoke.

``...That might be the case. It's not just the elderly that are refusing to go outside, but young people too... And I think the tendency becomes more prominent every time we encounter the monsters.''

So it really was their fear of the monsters that made people unable to go outside.

``Got it. Is there anything else on the bus you find concerning?''

``Let's see... I received some food...''

``Food?''

``Yes. The man in the black shirt sitting right behind me and his friends, they were handing out food they got during our stop to other passengers. He was eerily friendly too, like a completely different person from before.''

I thought about the men's actions.

Yuuna, Matsuri, the girl's mother, the doctor and I spent around half an hour looking for Ribbon Girl, whose name was Ruri-chan, but couldn't find her. While we were searching, a thought flashed through my head.

``Matsuri, can you find her with your power?''

``Eh?''

``Can't you find that twerp the same way you can locate where the monsters are?''

Matsuri remorsefully shook her head.

``Probably not... I don't know when I'll get that strange gut feeling. It's not like I detect them knowingly... And it doesn't tell me about anything other than those white monsters...''

``I see...''

Then our only option was to do it the hard way.

While we were searching for the girl, the mother's leg injury began acting up and made it hard for her to walk. We decided to return to the bus for the time being.

``Sorry, we still haven't found the girl! Please wait a little longer!''

Yuuna bowed before the rest of the passengers.

``Enough already!'' the brown-haired woman shouted.  ``How long do we have to wait for!? Just depart already! Those monsters could appear any moment!''

Her voice resonated through the bus. The others became as quiet as that woman was loud.

``A--Are you saying... We should abandon that girl and leave?'' Matsuri asked fearfully.

``That's right. You don't know where she went, do you? You don't have a way to find her, either! How long are you planning to search for her!? How many hours!? Or what, maybe several days!? We can't wait that long! We need to get to safety as soon as possible!''

Nobody in the bus could refute Brown Hair's words. In fact, she probably spoke for many of the passengers.

``I'm sorry... I'm sorry... I'm sorry...'' the girl's mother kept apologising with tears in her voice.

Yuuna looked at me, as if begging for help. But before I could say anything, Black Shirt cut into the conversation.

``Hey, how about we ask everyone on the bus for their opinion? Should we look for the kid until we find her or should we forget about her and move on? Huh, how 'bout that?''

``Please wait!''

Yuuna tried to stop him, but Brown Hair ignored her and advanced the topic.

``Let's do that! How about that, everyone!? People who think we should keep looking for the girl, stand up! We don't know how many days it'll take to find her! We don't know if the monsters will appear! Is there anyone who thinks we still absolutely have to find her despite all that? We'll decide by majority vote, so stand up if you think so!''

Glances began to dart across the bus, everyone trying to determine what the others were thinking. Lost in thought, unsure how other people would act. And unable to produce an answer, nobody would stand up.

``See, nobody stood up! Nobody wants to look for her! Come on, hurry up! We don't know when the monsters will come! Get on with it already!''

Brown Hair was tickled pink with triumph.

``Quit wasting our time! We've got elderly and injured here! What if their wounds get worse or the elderly start feeling bad, huh?''

Black Shirt was right. The girl's mother was in tears, but said nothing.

``But!''

Yuuna kept glancing between me and the rest of the passengers.

``Enough already!''

``Let's get to safety, quick!''

``We're not gonna find her anyway if it's just us searching...''

``Yep.''

``I'm tired... It hurts...''

Voices of malcontent began to pop up here and there.

``You see now? Start the bus already!'' Brown Hair said. Then Matsuri faintly, but firmly refused.

``No...''

Her voice was shaking.

``No way. We can't leave that girl behind. We'll search until we find her. I swear. Until we find her.''

Black Shirt glared at Matsuri. Frightened, she tensed up.

``Hey...''

Black Shirt's hand went towards Matsuri, but I stepped between the two.

``Wait. That `majority vote' you two just suggested wasn't fair at all. What did you say? `We don't know if the monsters will appear, so people who want to search for the brat until the end stand up'? You loaded the question with nothing but demerits to lead the person answering in the direction you want. And people who didn't stand aren't just those who want to start the bus. There are also those who couldn't produce an answer. Let me demonstrate,'' I looked around the bus, ``If I asked `Stand up if you want to depart because you only care about saving yourself and would leave a child to die', would the majority of people not still be sitting?''

``That's...''

Black Shirt and Brown Hair were at a loss for words.

``And you know what else you're getting massively wrong? A majority vote doesn't mean anything on this bus. All that matters is what Takashima Yuuna, Yokote Matsuri and I think. Yuuna fights the monsters and protects you. Matsuri and I get you to safe places. You can't force us to do anything because all you do is get protected by us, get that through your heads. And right now, Matsuri, Yuuna and I decided to look for that girl. End of story.''

While it was decided that we would look for the girl, few were proactive in cooperating with us. Many of them were afraid to go outside, and everyone was simply tired. Some must've been against looking for her, too.

Aside from myself, Matsuri, Yuuna, the girl's mother and the doctor, there were only a few people looking for the girl.

While we were searching around the gas station, Matsuri began talking to me.

``Um... Thank you very much for what you did there. For helping me when I said I wanted to search for her...''

``I didn't really care whether we would search for her or not. But you were so desperate.''

``...I just can't bring myself to abandon her.''

``Trying to atone for your parents?''

``...''

``You think your parents died because of you. So you want to save someone else's life to compensate for theirs, right?''

``...Yes. I mean... The balance won't even out otherwise. If someone died because of me, I have to save someone...''

``Stupid. Your parents didn't die because of you, and lives aren't on freaking scales. Human lives aren't numbers, you can't just even out deaths by saving lives.''

``But... I can't forgive myself...''

So it was just a matter of Matsuri's emotions.

I lit a cigarette and looked around. I began to have doubts we could really find a lost child just like that.

There are many cases where massive search parties are unable to find lost children over several days of searching. That's how hard finding a lost person is.

And in addition to that, we were dealing with the ever-present danger of white monsters suddenly appearing.

``Kumiko-san...''

Matsuri was looking at me with suspicion.

``What's wrong?''

``Ah... Uh, nothing...''

I didn't understand what she wanted, but it didn't matter either way

``Matsuri, are there any monsters nearby?''

``No... I don't think there are.''

``Where's the nearest monster? Can you tell that?''

``Uh... I did have a bad feeling a little earlier, but it's in a place very far from our route...''

``Tell me.''

Matsuri pulled a sketchbook out of her backpack, flipped through the pages and showed me the map she drew earlier.

I opened the map app on my phone and compared it with Matsuri's drawing. There was no reception so I could only access offline maps, but I could at least get a sense of distance and other minimal information.

I gave Matsuri her sketchbook back.

``Thanks. I'm gonna need to leave for a bit, but don't worry about it. I'll be back in a few hours.''

I left Matsuri and headed towards the bus.

\vspace{\baselineskip}

\vspace{\baselineskip}

I watched as Kumiko-san went towards the bus. She wouldn't assist with our search after all. Maybe something sudden came up?

When we were talking earlier... She was definitely suppressing a smile. It... could've been just my imagination, though.

Kumiko-san was definitely not a bad person, but she was definitely hard to understand.

She was a kind person who came to my help when the bus was split and arguing. But she was unnecessarily aggressive when dealing with the man in the black shirt and the brown-haired woman. Kumiko-san was smart, so she could've definitely convinced them without raising the tensions so high. Why did she talk like that?

Could it have been that Kumiko-san...

But I decided against weird speculation and focused on finding the lost girl.

``Ruri-chan!''

I had no idea where to look, so I just wandered around yelling.

How many times had passed since I began looking for Ruri-chan? An hour? No, it was probably more. Even a child could move a kilometre if given an hour. The longer we spent, the further she could've been.

I took a look around myself. There were houses and a forest, plenty of hiding spots. I remembered seeing news about the police and firefighters searching for a child that got lost in the mountains. There was a whole search party with police dogs. That's how much time and effort it takes to find a lost child. So just how much time would we have needed to find Ruri-chan with so few people?

``It's fine, we'll definitely find her!''

Yuu-chan must have felt my anxiety and encouraged me. Yuu-chan's words always helped me.

I was mediocre. A plain person who never stood out in class, average in everything. If I disappeared, nobody would've noticed. By becoming able to sense the monsters I became a little bit special, but aside from that tacked-on ability, I had nothing.

And yet Dad and Mom died because of me, a completely inconsequential being who provided nothing.

I had to make up for that. I had to balance it out with something positive, or else the scales wouldn't have been even.

I continued my search for the lost girl.

I looked towards the bus and saw someone looking at us through the window. Their eyes were exhausted and cloudy. I was a nuisance to them.

But even so.

I wanted to save someone.

I didn't want someone to die before my eyes.

I didn't want anyone to die again. And I would have searched for as long as it took.

The blisters on my feet had already burst from walking too much when I heard Yuu-chan's voice ring out.

``I found her! Matsuri-san, I found Ruri-chan!''

The girl was a few hundred metres away from the gas station, sitting down.

``You shouldn't be here alone. Let's go back.''

I crouched down next to her, but the girl didn't even look at me.

``Go back... Where?'' murmured Ruri-chan.

I meant to say ``to the bus'', but the words got stuck in my throat.

You're not supposed to return to a bus. You're supposed to return home. For the girl, it would've been her home back in Nara, where we departed from.

``Granny is sick and can't move, so she stays home. Daddy was at work, so I don't know where he is... I want to go home... They say to go home when it gets dark...''

The girl's voice was shaky.

She and her mother came there all the way from Nara. She had an old grandmother left back home. She had no way of contacting her father. She made that long trip with just her mother. Perhaps the girl was just trying to go home. Back to her home in Nara, even though it was impossible to do so on foot.

I embraced the girl, as gently as I could.

``It's fine. You'll get to come back. You'll get to go home very soon. Things are weird now, but one day it'll all be back to normal. It's okay. You'll come back home... So let's go, okay? Let's go somewhere safe just for now, alright?''

The girl let out a quiet ``Mhm''.

I put the girl on my back and came back to the gas station with Yuu-chan.

When her mother saw Ruri-chan, she tightly embraced the girl, tears streaming down her face.

``Matsuri, you girls found her?''

Kumiko-san suddenly appeared next to me.

``Yes... Yuu-chan found her.''

``Right. I was searching somewhere further away all this time. Glad we found her.''

Kumiko-san was looking at the girl embraced by her mother.

``Matsuri, you saved that girl. If you hadn't insisted on searching for her, we would've left her behind. You're her saviour. So, did that make you feel any better about your parents?''

``...No.''

``Thought so. You can't balance out negatives with positives in this world. But what you did was positive, that's a fact. You saved the life of one girl.''

``So there was meaning... In my survival at the cost of Dad and Mom's lives?''

``A life was saved because of you, so of course there was. I'm certain of it.''

``...Thank you very much...''

Kumiko-san had weird and cold sides to her, but she was definitely a kind person.

``Ruri-chan... That girl said she wanted to go home.''

``Right.''

``The world is all weird now... But I'm sure... We'll get to return one day. We'll just take shelter in Shikoku for a bit... Then go home.''

``What about you? Do you also want to go back home?''

``I... don't have a place to return to, now that Dad and Mom are dead, so I don't. But I want to return to my normal life. I want to go back to the days before these monsters appeared...''

Kumiko-san looked up at the dark, sunless sky.

\vspace{\baselineskip}

\vspace{\baselineskip}

We started up the bus again, heading towards the Great Seto Bridge.

As much as I would've liked our finding the girl to have been a happy ending, things weren't quite that simple. We might've found the girl, but it delayed us by several hours. Everyone was tired, and the mood in the bus was so heavy that barely anybody even talked to each other.

The rest of the passengers were looking at us with even less trust than before. It felt like more people began to view us with unfriendly eyes.

``...What was the right thing to do...?'' whispered Yuuna, sitting behind the driver's seat.

``We couldn't abandon Ruri-chan... But we also caused problems to the people here...''

``Don't worry about it. You can't solve everything in life perfectly. More importantly, you didn't get to sleep much, did you? Go sleep some more,'' I answered while driving.

``Okay...''

Yuuna answered but didn't close her eyes, instead staring at her hands.

There was music outside the windows. It was Dvorak's ``Going Home''. I took a look at the clock. It was 6 PM. The world was broken, yet the music still signalled the time to go home. I wondered if someone was still alive at the broadcasting facility.

Then, suddenly, I heard a strained voice next to my seat.

``Haah... Haah, haah, haah...''

The voice belonged to the brown-haired woman I argued with.

``What's wrong?'' Matsuri asked the woman worriedly.

Brown Hair's face was pale and tears welled up in her eyes. She spoke, as if delirious.

``It's scary... The sky... It's scary...''
