After the brown-haired woman said the sky was scary, the passengers began to stir.

I stopped the bus, stood up from my seat and went towards Brown Hair.

She was in an abnormal state. She was pale, her breathing ragged and forehead drenched in cold sweat. She stood up from her seat, likely trying to get as far as possible from the dreadful sky in the bus windows, but tripped and fell on the floor.

``Are you okay!?''

Yuuna tried to help Brown Hair up, but the woman roughly brushed her hand away.

``Eeek! Waaah!''

Brown Hair rose up with a shriek, wrapped her fingers around Yuuna's neck and began to choke her

``Urk, guh... Sto...''

``Stop it!''

I grabbed Brown Hair's wrists and pulled her hands off Yuuna's neck.

``E--E--Eeek! Aaagh!''

Brown Hair's breathing grew more ragged and she cowered on the spot while shrieking.

``Matsuri, there are zip ties and duct tape in the bag on the driver's seat. Bring them to me.''

``O--Okay!''

Just like I asked, Matsuri rushed to the driver's seat and brought me zip ties and duct tape. I got them at a convenience store we stopped by during the journey.

I pushed the squirming Brown Hair on the back with my leg, forcing her on the floor. With my knee firmly planted on her back to prevent her from getting up, I tied her arms behind her back with zip ties. Brown Hair tried to kick back in resistance, but I had Matsuri tie her ankles together while I held the woman's legs down.

After that I wrapped her body and legs with duct tape, thus fully sealing her movements.

``Move, I'll put her to sit there.''

A person sitting in the back stood up from their seat and I put Brown Hair in it.

``Wh... What happened with her?'' Yuuna was watching the restrained Brown Hair with worry.

``This woman said the sky was scary, didn't she? I've noticed the tendency to be afraid of the sky in some others too. Something's happening to the people on this bus.''

``What exactly...?''

I shook my head in response to Matsuri's concerned gaze.

``Not a clue. But you'd better not think this is the end of it.''

I started the bus up again, but the passengers' condition grew worse by the minute. None of them went wild like Brown Hair did, but the number of people calling the sky scary was increasing. Those afraid of the sky closed their curtains in order not to see the scenery outside. That must've not been enough to alleviate their fear, because when the bus stopped for a break, they brought a newspaper from a convenience store and began to stick it to the window glass. One of them must've been knowledgeable in Buddhism or something similar because they scribbled sutras and some weird incantations in Siddham on the paper with a marker.

The entire rear half of the bus was blocked off from the outside world with curtains and newspapers.

Those afraid of the sky gathered in the dark rear half, huddling like scared animals. Some were mumbling prayers.

Yuuna was watching over the situation on the bus with concern, while Matsuri was scared of the abnormal mood.

``We might be approaching the limit.''

Matsuri let out a confused ``Eh?'' when she heard me.

``Limit...?''

``The mental state of the people on the bus is way too bad. We might have a riot on our hands soon. It might be better to make people who are too far gone disembark, even by force.''

``Disembark...'' Matsuri asked fearfully, ``You mean to abandon them and leave them for dead?''

``Exactly. Only Brown Hair got bad enough to get violent against others for now, but others might become just like her in the future. If several people get violent in this tight space, driving the bus will be the last of our worries.''

``...''

Matsuri couldn't refute my words. She bit her lip and went silent.

``Abandoning someone...'' Yuuna began talking in Matsuri's stead, ``is something I can't do. I don't want to do it. Even if someone gets violent, I'll restrain them.''

``By force?''

``...Yes,'' Yuuna nodded, but her voice sounded uncertain.

``I see. But that's not the only problem about having too many passengers on board.''

``Is there... anything else?''

``It's food, Yuuna. You must've noticed by now, there's barely been any food left in the convenience stores and supermarkets we made our last few stops at. Normally it doesn't take a lot of time to get from Nara to Shikoku. Nobody would've expected a food shortage. But it's taking us much longer than estimated.''

``...''

``We already have people afraid of the sky, and soon we'll have the fear of starvation added to the mix. The bus is going to become a hellscape.''

``Kumiko-san, do you think we have to... drop off the people on the bus?''

Yuuna's questioning gaze was directed at me, and I answered.

``Truth be told, I don't care either way. I don't care whether we drop the mentally damaged ones now or keep carrying everyone till the end.''

Yuuna stared at me with confusion. I didn't care. No matter what I picked, Yuuna and Matsuri would have anguished either way.

By presenting the two of them with the possibility of choice, I made Yuuna and Matsuri pick between keeping something and throwing something away, between choosing what to sacrifice. The two would be distressed, confused, lose their temper and act irrationally. And I wanted to see that. It was a lot more interesting than just running the bus without doing anything.

With only a short distance remaining until the Great Seto Bridge, I stopped the bus again.

Not for a break, however, but because an argument between several people broke out. From what I overheard, it was a fight over water.

``Please stop fighting!''

Yuuna stood up from her seat and went to stop them. Matsuri followed behind her. Yuuna was planning to stop the quarrel herself, just like she said she would.

But the words of a child have no power to stop a heated-up adult. If the argument grew into a violent fight, Yuuna would have had no choice but to use force.

Expecting that, I was observing the entire argument from the start, but it didn't turn out to be that serious of an argument. But Yuuna and Matsuri's appearance didn't stop it. Two of Black Shirt's cronies stepped in and mediated the argument. I couldn't hear what they said very well from my seat, however.

Yuuna and Matsuri came back to their seats with relieved faces.

``Looks like the fighting's stopped. What happened?''

Matsuri answered my question.

``They were fighting over drinks, but someone who had a lot of water shared some with them and they stopped.''

``...''

Black Shirt's cronies were, evidently enough, steadily expanding their influence over the bus.

Then a man shakily approached the driver's seat. I readied myself to attack at a moment's notice. Some of the passengers were mentally broken already, and a sudden attack wasn't out of the question. I couldn't afford to be careless.

But the man passed me and instead began to stick the newspaper in his hand to the windshield.

``What the hell are you doing!?''

I seized the man.

``The outside is visible... The outside... Outside... Outside...''

The man kept muttering deliriously. I tied him up with zip ties and duct tape and put him on the rear seat, like the brown-haired woman.

The situation was growing worse by the minute. Even the still relatively sane people sitting in the front part of the bus had strong signs of fatigue on their faces.

``Just get there already... Faster... I can't take this anymore...'' someone was mumbling, their face cast downwards.

Even the relatively okay people were in a state like that.

``Ah'', Matsuri let out a sudden gasp. She took out her sketchbook and began drawing a map.

It was a map of the Great Seto Bridge's surroundings. Then Matsuri began filling in the road towards the bridge itself with black. She was filling it in more intensely than ever before.

``You felt them again?''

``Yes... On the road we need to take to get to the bridge...''

Could it have been that the monsters could sense us the same way Matsuri was able to sense them? It felt almost as if they were anticipating where we were going.

``We won't know until we check the roads better, but the Great Seto Bridge could also be unus--''

``What!?''

My words were cut off by Black Shirt, who came up to the driver's seat.

``I've been listening, are you trying to make us take another detour!? Huh!?''

``...Possibly.''

``You understand it, don't you!? Come on! Everyone on this bus is already at their limit! Don't take any more detours! I'm begging you, we can't handle it anymore! Come on! Just go straight for the bridge!''

The entire bus had their eyes directed at the shouting Black Shirt.

When he raised a voice of protest against a detour a little earlier, many of the gazes pointed at him were disapproving. But this time...

``He's right.''

``We can't handle wasting any more time.''

Voices in support of Black Shirt were growing in number. That's just how cornered everyone on the bus was.

``Kumiko-san, let's go'', said Yuuna. ``Let's cross the Great Seto Bridge and get to Shikoku. Don't worry, I'll fight the monsters even if they appear.''

Yuuna's voice was strong and willful.

``That's right, this girl can beat the crap out of those monsters! We can go further if she takes them out!'' shouted Black Shirt.

``...There's a problem'', said Matsuri with a strained voice.

``Problem?'' I asked.

``The monster blocking the way to the Great Edo Bridge... feels a little different. It's scarier than the ones before... It doesn't feel right. Even Yuu-chan might... not come out of fighting it unharmed...''

Black Shirt furiously glared at Matsuri, who was carefully selecting her words. I spoke out first, in order to prevent him from saying anything.

``Different from the earlier monsters, huh. We have to check it first.''

The monster Matsuri sensed was on the road we had to pass through, the Seto Chuo Expressway. The Seto Chuo Expressway was long, and the monster was around Kojima in Kurashiki city.
Yuuna, Matsuri and I arrived at a shrine on a small mountain in Kojima. It was relatively close to the expressway, so I assumed we could observe the monsters from up there.
The bus was stopped at the foot of the mountain. I offered Black Shirt to come with us, but he shook his head with a frightened face. He nearly died last time he went to take a look at the monsters, so maybe he was traumatised.

There were no signs of people anywhere near the shrine. It was already abandoned.

I found a ladder next to the main building and used it to climb on the roof. I took out the opera glasses I picked up at a department store we stopped at before and looked towards the Seto Chuo Expressway.

``...There they are.''

Floating above the expressway were several white monsters. But after I took a better look, I noticed that it wasn't just the white insectoid ones we've run into countless times before, but also a different type I've never seen before. The new one was also bigger than the regular ones.

``How is it, Kumiko-san?'' Yuuna called out to me from below.

``Yeah, they're where Matsuri said they would be. There's also one I've never seen...''

I jumped off the roof before finishing my sentence. Moments later, a tremendous sound roared out and the shrine blew apart as if from an explosion.

``Eh!? W--What!?''

Matsuri and Yuuna were confused.

``One of the monsters attacked. Looks like the new type of monster can attack from a distance.''

One of the monsters had something resembling a thorn. It shot out that thorn at us.

The distance between the shrine and the monsters' location was several hundred metres. Its accuracy was terrifying.

``Run away!'' I hurried Yuuna and Matsuri, and we began to descend down the mountain.

Another thorn came flying and dug into the earth where we stood just a moment earlier. The trees grazed by the thorn scattered around.

``Kyaaa!'' Matsuri shrieked, surrounded by earth and splinters flying through the air as we kept running.

When we got to the bus parked at the foot of the mountain, I started it up right away. Luckily, the thorn monster didn't shoot at our location.

The people in the bus, worried about the earlier loud sound, asked us about it. Our dismayed state made it clear it was something serious, too.

``We got attacked by the monsters. There's a different, way more troublesome new type of monster we haven't encountered before blocking the way to the Great Seto Bridge. Fighting that thing is too dangerous. We can't use the bridge.''

The passengers' despair showed on their faces after I explained the situation.

``W--Wait, don't just decide that!'' screamed Black Shirt and pointed at Yuuna. ``This brat is supposed to fight the monsters! Go! Go for the Great Seto Bridge!''

``I'll be fine, Kumiko-san. I'll fight and beat them! Please head for the Great Seto Bridge!'' Yuuna said to me.

``No way!'' shouted Matsuri, ``There's a monster who can attack from far away there! You can't fight without getting close to the enemy, Yuu-chan! It's too dangerous! You could get badly hurt or... even die!''

``We're at our limit too! Make the little brat fight!''

``Please stop this! Yuu-chan might be strong, but she still gets hurt when fighting! Are you not ashamed of yourself? Making such a young girl fight and face danger!?''

``Tch...''

Black Shirt glared at Matsuri with eyes that looked like he could attack her at any moment.

Yuuna with her punches was at a heavy disadvantage against an enemy who could attack from afar. The enemy was able to accurately locate us and shoot at us from a distance of several hundred metres. Even if Yuuna was to fight, the possibility of her getting shot to death before she got in range was high.

``It's not like we're out of options. We still can get to Shikoku via the Shimanami Expressway. Let's go there.''

I grabbed the steering wheel.

The Shimanami Expressway was a road that connected Hiroshima in Honshu to Ehime in Shikoku across a multitude of islands. It even allowed for pedestrian and bicycle traffic.

It was about a hundred kilometres away from the Great Seto Bridge. Naturally, we would need to make stops on the way, so getting there wouldn't be that easy.

As I was driving the bus, Yuuna was sitting there with a troubled expression.

``What, Yuuna, thinking that it would've been better if you fought and we went for the Great Seto Bridge?'' I called out to her.

``Yes... I mean, if I fought... We could've gotten to Shikoku, and that's the most important thing...''

``Aren't you just a ball of self-sacrificial thoughts.''

Yuuna met my sarcastic tone with a confused expression like she didn't understand the meaning of what I just said.

``Self-sacrificial?''

``It means trying to sacrifice yourself for others' sake. You get hurt all over and still fight for others, even though there's nothing for you to gain from it. That's what ``self-sacrifice'' means.''

Yuuna's clothes were tattered, and her body was covered in wounds from the previous battles.

``I don't think it's that'', Yuuna said in a sad voice, ``I don't think it's anything pretty like that. I just... I don't like seeing people fight or get hurt... That's my main reason. Everyone on this bus is suffering or angry... I don't like being here. I can't stand it. I fight for my own selfish reasons. So please don't worry about me getting hurt...''

``They're not selfish reasons'', Matsuri hugged Yuuna and said calmly, ''Yuu-chan, you definitely fight as a form of self-sacrifice. It doesn't matter why, as long as you're willing to get hurt for other people's sake, it's self-sacrifice. The situation in this bus isn't your responsibility either, Yuu-chan.

``...''

Yuuna's expression didn't get any brighter. No matter how kind Matsuri's words might've been, they couldn't reach Yuuna.

``Well, doesn't matter how much you want to fight, you'll have to hold back this time. You can't break through against a monster that shoots projectiles. The moment we try to get close to it so you can fight it, our bus gets shot and that's the end of it. You might be able to dodge the thorn it shoots, but the bus isn't anywhere as nimble as you. You can't solve this problem with your fists.''

As I talked, I thought about just how deep and wide of a gulf separated Yuuna and Matsuri.

How many stops had we made? I had already lost count.

Our bus made yet another stop on our way to the Shimanami Expressway, at a supermarket parking lot this time. Kumiko-san told me and Yuu-chan to get some sleep, but I wasn't able to sleep and just lay with my eyes closed. Yuu-chan, sitting next to me, was breathing in her sleep.

I wondered how much time had passed since we left Nara, since I hadn't checked the clock for a while. The more I thought about how long it was taking, the more it began to seem like the journey would never end, and that was an exhausting thought.

Then my thoughts were interrupted by a voice.

``Hey, wake up.''

I opened my eyes.

The man in the black shirt was standing next to me. His face was drained of all emotion. I've seen him angry or frustrated many times before, but his current face was but his current face was a lot more creepy and hard to read.

``...W--What is it?''

I realised that my voice was trembling.

``I need to talk to you. Come outside.''

The man was speaking quietly, in a whisper. He probably didn't want to wake up Yuu-chan, sleeping next to me. But I only realised that after I went outside, just like the man told me.
When I came out of the bus, there were two of Black Shirt's cronies as well as some other people with suspicious faces. They were all glaring at me.

The man in the black shirt grabbed my arm and took me away from the bus. The other people had us surrounded and there was no way to escape.

``I'd like to ask everyone's opinion!'' Black Shirt loudly said after we were a dozen or so metres away from the bus.

``I think it's better if we go to Shikoku through the Great Seto Bridge and not the Shimanami Expressway! Our stamina is going to run out soon! We have injured and sick people. And most importantly, we're nearly out of food! We don't have the time to waste. Don't you all agree!? If you think we should get to safety as soon as possible via the Great Seto Bridge, speak up!''

Everyone there began to support what the man in the black shirt just said.

``Yeah, that's right.'' ``Just as you say.'' ``How long is this journey gonna go on?'' ``Let's hurry up and get to safety.'' ``I can't take it anymore.'' ``What if someone dies?''
It was like their anger and frustration became voices and overflowed from them. A chill ran down my spine.

Black Shirt spoke to his surroundings.

``The brat named Takashima Yuuna who can fight the white monsters agreed with going to the Great Seto Bridge! The woman driver, Karasuma, doesn't really object to it either!  In the end, the only person objecting is this little brat right here! If she agrees to go through the Great Seto Bridge, we can finally get to Shikoku, to safety! If this brat agrees! So...''

Black Shirt glanced at me.

``We just gotta make it so she can't act cocky with us anymore. I bet she'll become real obedient if we just rough her up a little.''

\vspace{\baselineskip}

\vspace{\baselineskip}

After I finished smoking and returned to the parking lot, I stumbled upon a most interesting sight.

Matsuri was surrounded by several people outside the bus, including Black Shirt.

I hid behind a car abandoned in the parking lot and checked out the situation.

Black Shirt was grabbing Matsuri's arm, while she was trying to shake him off and run away.

``Stop! Stop it please!''

``Shut up!''

Black Shirt slapped Matsuri's face and kicked her in the stomach.

``Agh, *cough* *hack*''

She kneeled, holding her stomach.

``Ugh... *cough* It... It hurts... Eek...''

Black Shirt grabbed the cowering Matsuri by the hair and raised her face. Her eyes were filled with tears.

``What shall I do with you now...''

Black Shirt had a sadistic smile on his face.

I watched over the situation, with no intention of helping Matsuri.

Nothing life-threatening had happened so far. I wanted things to go much, much further towards the point of no return. I wanted to see Matsuri and Yuuna's reactions when that happened.

They had plenty of ways of forcing Matsuri into obedience. They could make her submit through violence. They could also force her through humiliation. Anyone would become obedient after they were put through enough pain to make their spirit break. There was also the option of filming humiliating videos.

``W--Wait...''

Matsuri desperately forced her voice through tears. I thought she'd beg them to not hit her or to let her go. But I was wrong.

``This... isn't right. What you're doing is... a crime. Police and law are meaningless right now, but if we finally go back to peace... If Shikoku really is a safe place... You'll regret having committed a crime now. So please stop...''

What the hell was she saying? \\
``If we finally go back to peace?'' \\
``If Shikoku is a safe place?'' \\
Was she telling them to live on the straight and narrow? \\
...Was she insane?

There was no way we were returning to our old world. There was no way of knowing how many areas of Japan were still safe, but from what I could guess based on the social media posts at the moment of the incident, Kanto and Kansai were pretty much entirely destroyed. With the core areas of Japan gone, the country was already done for.

Even if Shikoku and a few other areas remained safe, we would never return to our old lives. We would never return to our old world.
Was Matsuri blind to that? Was Matsuri that much of a fool?

``Even if the world is so messed up right now... We'll definitely get our old world back if we try. And when that happens, you won't be able to lead a proper life anymore!''
Matsuri squeezed the words out of herself.

(What the hell...)

Matsuri wasn't blind to it. Matsuri believed. She wished.

That people could take back their old world, no matter how battered they were...

That they could go back to their old world for certain...

She believed, strongly and fiercely.

``Shut up!''

Black Shirt hit Matsuri in the face. Over and over.

But Matsuri didn't give in. She kept prattling on about nonsense like ``when the world goes back to normal'' ``when the world is peaceful again''.

I... When I compared Takashima Yuuna and Yokote Matsuri, I thought Takashima Yuuna was my polar opposite. But I was wrong.

Yokote Matsuri was my real polar opposite. I had to remove her from my sight.

I stood up from my hiding spot.

``Hey, what are you people doing here?''

Black Shirt and his cronies were visibly disturbed to see me. Matsuri stared at me with shock.

``K--Kumiko-san...?''

``Matsuri, close your eyes!''

``Eh?''

``I said close your eyes! Don't open them until I tell you to!''

``Okay...''

After I saw Matsuri close her eyes, I closed in on one of Black Shirt's cronies and grabbed his ear. At the same time, I pulled out a fruit knife I was hiding and cut his ear off. I threw the ear on the ground and stomped on it with my shoe.

The man fell to the ground with a scream and began writhing in pain, holding his ear.

Black Shirt looked at him, let out a choked-down shriek and fell on his rear.

``If the rest of you don't want the same to happen, get on the bus right now,'' I said as I displayed the blood-stained fruit knife for everyone to see.

``You're all just cooperating with the guy in the black shirt just because he promised to share food and drinks with you, right? None of you actually wanted to hurt Matsuri, did you? If you did, raise your hand.''

Nobody raised their hand, as they all stood pale and downcast.

``Doesn't look like it. Don't worry then. I'm confiscating all of the food and water Black Shirt has gathered and distributing it between everyone. You've got no more reason to follow him. Hurry up and get on the bus if you get me!''

I flicked my knife and everyone rushed towards the bus, as if running away.

I threw away the knife and restrained the writhing man on the ground with zip ties and duct tape. I also taped his ear so the blood wouldn't be visible.

``It's okay now, open them.''

Matsuri opened her eyes on my command. She looked at the tied-up man moaning in pain with disturbance.

``K--Kumiko-san... What happened?''

She must've realised what happened based on what she heard and was seeing.

``I would've lost if I fought head-on, there were more of them. So I made a flashy show of force to make them back down. He's not gonna die just because I cut his ear off. We have bandages and disinfectant on the bus. The doctor will treat him.''

I approached Black Shirt as I spoke to Matsuri, restraining him with zip ties and bandages as well. He had gone weak with fear and put up no resistance.

``I'll take care of this guy.''

``Take... care?''

I didn't answer and began rummaging through the abandoned cars in the parking lot, eventually finding one with the key still inserted. I threw Black Shirt on the rear seat and started the engine.

\vspace{\baselineskip}

It took Kumiko-san an hour to come back after she drove away in the car.

She grabbed the man in the black shirt by his hair and dragged him out of the car, then both of them came back to the rest of us on the bus.

``Aah, haah... Eek...''

The man's face was pale and covered in sweat.

He was in the same state as the brown-haired woman who went crazy earlier. His limbs were tied, so he couldn't struggle either, but who knows what would've happened if he was free.

``Kumiko-san, what happened to him!?'' asked Yuu-chan after seeing the man's state.  ``You cut off someone's ear with a knife earlier, too... What's going on, Kumiko-san!?''

Kumiko-san didn't answer and just pushed the man in the black shirt into an empty seat. Afterwards she sat down in the driver's seat and started the bus.

``Kumiko-san!''

Yuu-chan repeated her question, nearly yelling this time, but no answer came.

Kumiko-san took the man away, and when he came back he was mentally unstable --- just what happened to him?

Still ignoring Yuu-chan, she turned to me, her hands still on the steering wheel.

``Matsuri, I have a question. Assuming that Shikoku really is a safe and peaceful place, what do you plan to do after we get there? How are you planning to live once we're back in peace?''

``...Uh, is this really the time for...''

``Just answer.''

Her voice made it clear I didn't have a choice in the matter. I wondered what she meant by her question. I had no idea. What was the correct answer? I had no idea.

I wavered, thought about it... And then just said what I honestly thought.

``Uh... I want to live normally. My... dad and mom are dead... So I definitely won't be able to live like I used to... But I still want my life to be as close to my old one as possible...''

Reluctantly getting out of bed, still sleepy, eating the same breakfast as always, taking lessons at school, having fun with friends after school and maybe going to a club, going to bed while thinking about how uneventful my day was...

``That's the kind of life I want to have...''

Kumiko-san nearly spat her response out.  ``How normal.''

``Yes... Normal.''

``Mind-numbingly normal. You're witnessing an apocalyptic event and have a special power that lets you sense monsters and all you want is to go back to a boring life like that?''

``...Yes.''

``Disgustingly normal.''

``...Yes.''

``That's right... You're normal. A normal, nice girl. A normal life. And there's nothing more incredible than someone who wants and can achieve that. That's so wonderful. So precious.''

Kumiko-san's face was emotionless. I couldn't understand what she was trying to say. She continued.  ``I don't know how long it's been since we left Nara, but we've been having people lose their minds because of some weird phobia that makes them afraid of the sky. After some observation, I noticed that people took a particularly strong mental hit after encountering those white monsters. I thought, what if it was fear of those monsters all along? So... I went for a test.''

``A... test?''

``That's right. The brown-haired woman. While you were searching for the lost kid near the gas station, I took her to a place where those monsters were. Matsuri can sense them, so getting there by car was easy. I drove close to them and got chased, but got away somehow. Man, that was fun! After we lost the monsters, the brown-haired woman's mind was completely gone. I think those monsters induce more fear in humans than what the danger of a threat would normally do.''

I was at a loss for words. Kumiko-san continued.

``The man in the black shirt went through the same thing as Brown Hair just now. It was a good time. I get to taste the thrill of being chased around by monsters and see people scream in terror and go crazy, it's exhilarating. I would've never gotten the chance if not for this situation. And since I don't dirty my hands personally and they just go crazy on their own, I don't even have to feel any guilt for breaking someone.''

``Kumiko-san... Why would you...''

Yuu-chan's voice was shaking.

Then, Kumiko-san suddenly slammed on the gas and sped up. Yuu-chan and I nearly fell from the jolt.

``Listen up!'' Kumiko-san roared out so everyone in the bus could hear her, ``This bus isn't going to Shikoku! It's never... Never going to reach a safe place!''
